# ♻️ Global Waste Token Exchange

Welcome to the Global Waste Token Exchange (GWTE), a decentralized platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts! This Web3 project addresses the real-world problem of inequitable waste management and recycling across countries. By tokenizing recycling quotas as fungible tokens, nations can trade excess capacity or deficits in a transparent, immutable manner, promoting global sustainability and compliance with international environmental agreements like the Paris Accord or UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Imagine a world where developing countries with limited recycling infrastructure can purchase quotas from industrialized nations with surplus capabilities, incentivizing efficient resource use and reducing global waste pollution.

## ✨ Features

🌍 Tokenized recycling quotas for countries to trade  
💱 Decentralized exchange for buying/selling quota tokens  
📊 Transparent tracking of national waste metrics via oracles  
🗳️ Governance for updating quota allocations and rules  
🔒 Secure escrow for atomic trades between participants  
✅ Compliance verification to ensure trades align with global standards  
🏆 Staking and rewards for countries meeting recycling targets  
🚫 Penalty mechanisms for non-compliance  
📈 Analytics dashboard (off-chain integration) for quota trends  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Countries (Participants)**

- Register your country and initial quota allocation via the Registry contract.
- Mint quota tokens based on verified recycling capacity using the Token contract.
- List offers to sell excess quotas or bid to buy deficits on the Exchange contract.
- Use the Escrow contract for safe, trustless trades—tokens are locked until both parties confirm.
- Submit real-world recycling data through the Oracle contract for validation and adjustments.
- Stake tokens in the Staking contract to earn rewards for overachieving targets.
- Participate in governance proposals via the Governance contract to vote on system updates, like annual quota resets.

**For Verifiers and Regulators**

- Query the Compliance contract to check if a country's trades and quotas meet international standards.
- Use the Analytics contract to retrieve historical trade data and quota balances.
- Verify oracle-submitted data for authenticity and trigger penalties if discrepancies are found.

Trades are settled instantly on the blockchain, ensuring no double-spending or fraud. All interactions are permissioned for verified country representatives, with smart contracts enforcing rules automatically.

## 📜 Smart Contracts (8 in Total)

This project leverages 8 Clarity smart contracts for modularity, security, and scalability:

1. **Token Contract**: Defines the fungible Waste Quota Token (WQT) using the SIP-010 standard. Handles minting, burning, and transfers of tokens representing recycling quotas (e.g., tons of recyclable material per year).

2. **Registry Contract**: Manages country registrations, including verification of representatives and initial quota assignments. Stores metadata like country codes and authorized principals.

3. **Exchange Contract**: A decentralized order book for listing buy/sell offers of WQT. Matches trades and emits events for off-chain monitoring.

4. **Escrow Contract**: Facilitates secure trades by locking tokens/assets until conditions (e.g., mutual confirmation or oracle validation) are met, preventing disputes.

5. **Oracle Contract**: Integrates external data feeds for real-world recycling metrics (e.g., via trusted oracles). Updates quota balances based on verified performance data.

6. **Governance Contract**: Enables DAO-style voting for system parameters, such as quota multipliers or penalty rates. Uses WQT for voting power.

7. **Staking Contract**: Allows countries to stake WQT to earn rewards (e.g., bonus tokens) for exceeding recycling goals, with slashing for underperformance.

8. **Compliance Contract**: Enforces rules like maximum trade limits per country or anti-manipulation checks. Queries other contracts to validate actions and applies penalties (e.g., token burns).

These contracts interact seamlessly: For example, a trade on the Exchange triggers Escrow, which consults Compliance and Oracle before finalizing via Token transfers.
